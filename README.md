# Computational Artificial Market (CAM)

## Overview

The Computational Artificial Market (CAM) is a simulation framework designed to model and analyze market behaviors, trading strategies, and interactions among agents in a controlled environment. This project aims to provide researchers, educators, and practitioners with tools to explore market dynamics and test trading strategies without the risks associated with real-world trading.

## Features

- **Agent-Based Modeling**: Simulates various types of market participants, each with customizable behaviors and strategies.
- **Dynamic Market Environment**: Includes a realistic order book, price matching, and event handling to mimic real market conditions.
- **Data Generation**: Produces synthetic market data, including price histories and trading volumes, for analysis and strategy testing.
- **Extensible Framework**: Easily adaptable to incorporate new agents, strategies, and market structures.
